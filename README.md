# horiseon_HW_Challenge

## Description
This webpage was deployed for homework challenge 1 in which I had to edit the html formatting and fix a few bugs for a fake company landing page.

![Horiseon landing page includes a header with three navigation links and an image](https://github.com/mcgrane18482/horiseon_hw_challenge/issues/1#issue-1724869395)

## Credits
Starter code was provided for me from RUT-VIRT-FSF-FT-05-2023-U-LOLC, the Rutgers Fullstack Flex bootcamp directory on GitLab.
